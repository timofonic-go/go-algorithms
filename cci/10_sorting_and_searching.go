Merge Sort | Runtime: 0 ( n log ( n)) average and worst case. Memory: Depends.

Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges them back together.
Each of those halves has the same sorting algorithm applied to it.
Eventually, you are merging just two single element arrays.
It is the "merge" part that does all the heavy lifting.

The merge method operates by copying all the elements from the target array segment into a helper array,
keeping track of where the start of the left and right halves should be (helperleft and rightCursor).
We then iterate through helper, copying the smaller element from each half into the array. At the end, we
copy any remaining elements into the target array.

/**
Quick Sort | Runtime: O( n log(n) ) average, O( n2 ) worst case. Memory: O( log(n) ).

In quick sort we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than the
partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed
efficiently through a series of swaps (see below).

If we repeatedly partition the array (and its sub-arrays) around an element, the array will eventually become
sorted. However, as the partitioned element is not guaranteed to be the median (or anywhere near the
median), our sorting could be very slow. This is the reason for the O(n2) worst case runtime.

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.htm

So why think about quicksort when merge sort is at least as good?
That's because the constant factor hidden in the big-Î˜ notation for quicksort is quite good.
In practice, quicksort outperforms merge sort, and it significantly outperforms selection sort and insertion sort.

Bubble Sort | Runtime: 0( n2 ) average and worst case. Memory: 0( 1) .

In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater
than the second. Then, we go to the next pair, and so on, continuously making sweeps of the array until it is
sorted. In doing so, the smaller items slowly "bubble" up to the beginning of the list.

/**
Binary Search

In binary search, we look for an element x in a __sorted array__ by first comparing x to the midpoint of the array.
If xis less than the midpoint, then we search the left half of the array. If x is greater than the midpoint, then
we search the right half of the array. We then repeat this process, treating the left and right halves as subarrays.

Again, we compare x to the midpoint of this subarray and then search either its left or right side. We
repeat this process until we either find x or the subarray has size 0.
